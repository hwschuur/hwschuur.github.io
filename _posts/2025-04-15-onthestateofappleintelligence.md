Many articles have been written about the state of Apple Intelligence. Let me quote a few that I find insightful, starting with [Gruber's `Something is Rotten in the State of Cupertino'](https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino):

>  When mediocrity, excuses, and bullshit take root, they take over. A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.

Next, [Om's `Apple Intelligence: Fud, Dud or Both'](https://om.co/2025/03/13/apple-intelligence-fud-dud-or-both/):

> Apple lacks the moral authority of Steve Jobs to defy the markets, streamline their product lineup, and focus the company. Instead, they do what a complex business often does: they do more.

And finally, [`Apple’s AI isn’t a letdown. AI is the letdown' from  Allison Morrow at CNN](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/03/27/tech/apple-ai-artificial-intelligence):

> If AI is 100% accurate, it’s a fantastic time saver. If it is anything less than 100% accurate, it’s useless. […] Bottom line: Apple is not the laggard in AI. AI is the laggard in AI.
