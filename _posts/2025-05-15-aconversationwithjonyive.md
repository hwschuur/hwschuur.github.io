A rare one-hour interview with one of the greatest designers of our time. As Ive points out, a product always reflects the values, sophistication, and love of its designers. And indeed, one can always _feel_ when something was designed not to serve people, but in service of power or profit instead. And when a product isn't (sufficiently) working, it's uglyâ€”no matter how beautiful it may seem.
