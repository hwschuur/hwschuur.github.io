Rare look into the future through Apple's machine learning researchers. Super cool to see [Pixar's Luxo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr._(character)) come to life. The video demonstration is definitely worth a watch. Assuming this would materialize into an actual product, I'm curious how Apple envisions the mobility (dare I say wearability) aspect of it.
