Artificial Intelligence (AI) is moving so fast it's impossible to keep up. The latest large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. It exhibits remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, and challenges our understanding of learning and cognition.

Microsoft Research [wrote](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) [a long paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf) claiming that GPT-4 has ‘sparks’ of artificial general intelligence (AGI): AI capable of learning any task or subject. Bill Gates [disagrees](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun).

As for me, I'm with Gates, and I'm particularly worried about the dark side of AI: we need to start mitigating its worst-case [capitalistic](https://waag.org/sites/waag/files/2020-07/Marleen%20Stikker-Essay-VNG%20Smart%20Society%20Cases%20Open%20the%20black%20box.pdf), [societal](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/hoogleraar-computerwetenschappen-vreest-opmars-ai-wilt-u-50-euro-extra-betalen-voor-een-mens-toets-1~b5a92a0d/), and [environmental](https://vng.nl/artikelen/column-marleen-stikker-ecologische-intelligentie) impact. We need to do this fast, as [the road from LLM to existential crisis is short](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html). Indeed, creating technology that mimics humans requires that we get very clear on who we are.
