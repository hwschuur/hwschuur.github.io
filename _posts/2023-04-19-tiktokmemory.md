Remarkable results from a study on the impact of social media: short video streams (e.g. TikTok) have a significant detrimental impact on our prospective memoryâ€”our ability to remember to execute a planned action while doing an unrelated task.
Interestingly, the other platforms studied (i.e. Twitter and YouTube) do _not_ significantly affect memory performance. Another good reason to remove TikTok from your phone (if it's still on there).

The authors made their setup, datasets, and analysis scripts available [on Github](https://github.com/mimuc/media-prospective-memory) to reproduce and extend their results and analysis.
