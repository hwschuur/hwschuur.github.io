It was time to get this story out of my system. So did an ðŸ’¥ [Ignite talk at DevOpsDays London 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asEgV4ZWcXA&list=PLuEbc43fHqLhPwles4En070_CJ-aCLqdf&index=18) (it was a great experience to pour my thoughts into this relentless format and get to the essence of what I was trying to convey) and wrote a bit more detailed Medium blog.
