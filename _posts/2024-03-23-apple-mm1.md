This month, Apple published a paper announcing and detailing 'MM1', its own generative AI LLM. MM1 [appears to be](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611) comparable to market-leading models on several benchmarks. I'm curious to learn to which extent MM1 will be part of the next generation of Siri—Apple's own, more-than-a-decade-old 'chatbot' assistant—particularly in the light of Apple's recent talks with Google to [let Gemini power iPhone AI features](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools). 

 We should expect to learn more about this during this year's WWDC; not in the last place because [employees from Apple's former car project teams move to Apple’s AI division](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai).
