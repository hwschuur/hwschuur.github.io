Interesting perspective and line of thinking from Cal Paterson. He motivates why 'industry structure' is the main driver for business success and why things don't seem to look too pretty for LLMs. In other words: aren't LLMs the 'Netscape of AI'? (personally I think yes; I expect effective application and tailoring of LLMs to a relevant domain to be a key requirement for LLM business success.)
